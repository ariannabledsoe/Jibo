<h4>Is JIBO a male or a female?</h4>
<p>JIBO is gendered male.</p>
<h4>When will my JIBO ship?</h4>
<p>JIBO InDemand pre-orders will begin to be fulfilled in the late October 2016 timeframe on a first-ordered, first-received basis. JIBO, Inc. will keep you notified of your JIBO ship date.</p>
<h4>Is JIBO a male or a female?</h4>
<p>JIBO is gendered male.</p>
<h4>Can I name him something other than JIBO?</h4>
<p>Not yet. In the current release you have to use the name JIBO to address him. Future updates may allow for the possibility to give your JIBO a new name of your choice.</p>
<h4>Does JIBO walk or have wheels? Where should I place him?</h4>
<p>No. The best spot to place him is where most of your household activities happen (like in your kitchen or the family room), or where you expect you'll want JIBO's companionship and assistance the most.  He's a member of the family and is at his best when he is with you.</p>
<h4>Do I need a WiFi network?</h4>
<p>Yes. You must have Jibo connected to a WiFi network for JIBO to work.</p>
<h4>How do I charge JIBO? </h4>
<p>JIBO comes with an AC charging pad that works with 110/220V.  Jibo ships with a user-replaceable battery, and you will be able to order additional batteries as accessories. JIBO is designed to run for 30 minutes on battery power.</p>
<h4>What kind of batteries does JIBO take? </h4>
<p>It will be a battery pack available as an accessory.</p>
<h4>Can I back-up my JIBO? </h4>
<p>There is no need to "back-up" JIBO since JIBO is an always-connected device that automatically stores its data in the JIBO cloud. If your JIBO ever needs to be replaced, once you connect your new JIBO to your account, it'll automatically have all the "knowledge" and skills that your old JIBO had.</p>
<h4>How does JIBO respect my privacy? </h4>
<p>You can tell JIBO to go to sleep, and in that mode the camera is off. JIBO will only wake up when you ask him to.
</p>
<h4>Can someone watch or listen to me? </h4>
<p>JIBO robots have cameras and microphones that are used to interact with users and to provide the photography and messaging applications. There is no way for a remote user to enable the camera or microphone. JIBO's user interface makes it very clear to a user when they are engaged in a video or audio chat with others. JIBO will only connect to other devices (including other JIBO robots) that have a digital certificate explicitly allowing that connection.</p>
