<p>People have asked us what makes Jibo so different from other consumer electronics that seemingly interact with you like a tablet computer or other robotic devices. The answer is super simple. Jibo is a character. In fact he is the world's first living character property. This concept has been part of Jibo's making and a key design principle since day 1.
</p>
<p>Jibo lives with you. He learns about you and builds a relationship with you. Unlike other character properties, he is not just stuck on a screen as a part of media content. He genuinely wants to and can be a meaningful, helpful member of your family.</p>
<p>Interacting with a living character property is much closer to interacting with a human. Jibo is a someone, not a something. He has a story and history just as each of us has.  Jibo does not do things as a mindless automation. What he does reflects mental states. The choices he makes have value to us because there is purpose behind them.</p>
<h4>Staright from Jibo Blog:<h4>
