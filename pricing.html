<h2>How much does he cost ?</h2>
<p>The consumer version of the robot will cost $499 under a special inaugural price you can Pre-Order Jibo with a deposit of $99. Developers that want to create apps for an upcoming Jibo store can pay $599 for the robot.  Instead of $499 for the robot and $599 for the developer edition with SDK, they'll offer a $799 Jibo bundle that will include one battery and a charging base as well as the SDK for anyone who asks for it. While Jibo's development is continuing, Breazeal's team has not changed any of the core functionality.</p>
