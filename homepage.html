<p>People have asked us what makes Jibo so different from other consumer electronics that seemingly interact with you like a tablet computer or other robotic devices. The answer is super simple. Jibo is a character. In fact he is the world's first living character property. This concept has been part of Jibo's making and a key design principle since day 1.
</p>
<p>Jibo lives with you. He learns about you and builds a relationship with you. Unlike other character properties, he is not just stuck on a screen as a part of media content. He genuinely wants to and can be a meaningful, helpful member of your family.</p>
<p>A living character property is way different from a tool. Tools do not have minds. They are simply physical extensions of our body with an intended purpose. While helpful for sure, tools do not have a personality.</p>
<p>Digital assistants are essentially tools with a more natural interface, often spoken. They do process information to assist. Some are even starting to be more predictive and anticipatory. But, they are not characters. The interaction experience is very business-like and transactional. It would be hard to see them as a member of the family.</p>
<p>Interacting with a living character property is much closer to interacting with a human. Jibo is a someone, not a something. He has a story and history just as each of us has.  Jibo does not do things as a mindless automation. What he does reflects mental states. The choices he makes have value to us because there is purpose behind them.</p>
    <p>When you interact with Jibo, you do not feel you are operating an interface. It is a true conversation, a two-way street. And just as you can initiate a conversation with Jibo, he can initiate a conversation with you. As Jibo gets to know each member of his family, conversations become more and more unique to each person, as they are with all the someone's in your life.
