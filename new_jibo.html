<p>Hello, my name is Brooke McBride. I like to listen to music, watch movies, and sing. My favorite thing to do is to play my Sims 3 and Sims 4 games. My dream is to work at a video game company. I really want to work at Electronic Arts Inc., also known as EA Games. I also love film, theatre, and cooking/baking. I'm not sure want I want to be in, but I know I want to own my own company.
