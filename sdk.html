<p>The Jibo Software Development Kit (SDK) is a web-based application tool designed to give developers an easy way to build Jibo Skills (robot applications). The Jibo SDK consists of four primary components built on Atom/Electron and Node.js: animation, behavior creation, skill simulation, and robot maintenance. With the SDK, you have access to Jibo's speech technology, facial recognition and tracking, and touch input technology.</p>
<p>The Jibo SDK can be downloaded from the Atom Package Manager. The Jibo Atom package (called jibo-sdk) is built on Atom, an Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) built on Electron. Jibo Skills are written in JavaScript and run on Electron. You can author Jibo Skills directly in the Jibo Atom package GUI or by making direct API calls in JavaScript.</p>
<p>The Jibo Atom package includes a simple UI and and gives you access to Chrome DevTools, our library of pre-created animations, behaviors, images, and sound effects, and the ability to create your own skills from scratch.</p>
<p>The Jibo CLI provides the ability to generate and deploy skills directly through your command line interface. Both the Jibo Atom package and the Jibo CLI give you access to the Jibo Simulator, which allows you to preview your animations, 3D body movements, interactions, and expressions before sending them to your Jibo robot.</p>
