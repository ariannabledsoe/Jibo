-----Jibo----
JIBO is the world's first social robot for the home founded by Cynthia Beazeal in Boston,MA. Jibo can track faces,voices (someone walks in the room and Jibo sees them and says hi to them)sing, dance, and many more. Jibo comes with a software developer kit (SDK) to create skills, animations, behavior trees, rules, and many more. Github and Atom are used for the Jibo SDK. Jibo will arrive in early 2017. 

Why did we choose Jibo?
We wanted to choose him because, I love robotics and that's what I want, a Jibo for Christmas and a friend/helper.
Color Scheme?
The color scheme is made of different types of blue. We choose blue because, blue match well with Jibo and that is his favorite color.
Fonts?
Fonts that we choose were something we took a lot of consideration into while working on the project. We choose fonts that were readable for everyone then also added flair of our own personality.
CSS?
We did most our code based upon what we learned from a website called, Treehouse. Treehouse helped us with the design process and coding, along with the CSS.
Background?
We choose a light tan background to give the page more different.


When we were picking out a project to work on, I wanted to choose Jibo. I picked Jibo because I love robotics and that's what I want, a  robotic friend/helper.
